+ The term (blank) is traditionally used in HCI to describe the involvement of users and stakeholders in design processes, with pretext of disturbing control to participants to shape their technological future.
- Participation

+ The (blank) can encompass an individual or a group of users working together.
- User

+ By comparison, is exploratory by nature and has the ability to pull together seemingly disconnected areas and opinions and to ultimately arrive at something new and meaningful. It all starts with empathy.
- Design

+ Is the process of learning about ordinary users by observing them in action to understand in detail how they perform their tasks and achieve their intended goals.
- Task Analysis

+ Types of Task Analysis
- Cognitive Task Analysis and Hierarchical Task Analysis

+ Is focused on understanding tasks that require decision-making, problem-solving, memory, attention and judgment.
- Cognitive Task Analysis

+ Is focused on decomposing a high-level task subtasks.
- Hierarchical Task Analysis

+ Available at any time. User should not need to close the main application. Continuous access concurrent to main application Windows versus Non-windows based systems
- Availability 

+ Users who use help system are in difficulty correct error handling and predictable behavior otherwise user will not rely on help for getting assistance.
- Robustness

+ Help matches actual system behaviour Otherwise user is disappointed help covers complete system Otherwise user will be frustrated.
- Accuracy and Completeness

+ Between different parts of the help system and paper documentation In terms of content, terminology and style of presentation.
- Consistency

+ Adaptation of help system according to context allows user to interact in a way appropriate to user experience and task at hand.
- Flexibility 

+ Does not prevent the user continuing with normal work.
- Unobtrusiveness 

+ User help on particular command
- Command assistance

+ Help request interpreted according to context in which it occurs.
- Context sensitive help

+ User works through basics of application in a test environment. (e.g. working with examples or watching a demonstration)
- On-line tutorials

+ Provides a full description of the system’s functionality and behaviour in a systematic manner paper documentation is made available on computer.
- On-line documentation

+ Specific tool leads the user through task, step by step, using user’s answers to specific questions .
- Wizards task 

+ Monitor user behaviour and offer contextual advice can be irritating 
- Assistants

+ Provide information about correct usage when an error occurs.
- Command prompts

+ Use knowledge of the context, individual user, task and domain to provide help adapted to user's needs.
- Adaptive Help Systems

+ Avoid blocks of text rather use clear logical sections.
- Physical Layout Design

+ Where to look for a particular information clear indication of summary and example information
- Consistency

+ Through (blank), we are able to put ourselves in other people's shoes and connect with how they might be feeling about their problem, circumstance, or situation.
- Empathy

+ Is simply crucial to a human-centered design process such as design thinking as it helps you set aside your own assumptions about the world to gain insight into your users and their needs instead
- Empathy

+ (Blank) of the design thinking process is a time for you to collect as many experiences, insights and observations as possible, so you can build a solid foundation for the rest of your design project.
- Empathize stage

+ Is the first step in design thinking because it is a skill that allows us to understand and share the same feelings that others feel.
- Empathy

+ The next step is to define the above feelings and identify the main problem to be solved. I
- Define

+ This process is where ideas are generated. Students can learn empathy here when you teach them new and different ways to find solutions to a problem -
- Ideate

+ In the prototyping phase, students get to make and create the solution to the problem.
- Prototype

+ During testing, empathy plays a key role in shaping of the user's experience.
- Test

+ Are exercises we give to a target group in a design project; from these, we can get an understanding about their lives.
- Probes for context mapping 

+ It includes materials for activities over a short period
- Typical probes kit

+ Are an approach to qualitative user research where face-to-face research is impractical or inappropriate.
- Cultural Probes

+ (blank) in human-computer interaction is particularly useful for understanding environment where stakeholders interact to complete complex tasks involving the need for coordination and exchange of information.
- Ethnographic research

+ Is a qualitative orientation to research that emphasizes the detailed observation of people in naturally occurring settings.
- Ethnography

+ Currently used in HCI clearly have their origins in social anthropology.
- Ethnographic approaches

+ Focuses on long-term studies spanning weeks, months, or even years. Information may be collected through participant observation, interviews, audio or video recording, observer logs, artifact collection, diaries and photographs.
- Traditional ethnography

+ Are typically performed with the potential users of a design, as part of an ideation phase or during early concept development.
- User interviews

+ Aristotle's 7 Element of Good Storytelling
- Plot, Character, Theme, Dialogue/Diction, Melody, Decor, Spectacle

+ What are users trying to achieve/overcome?
- Plot

+ Who are the users: not just demographically, but what insights do you need to understand what they (and their needs) are truly like?
- Characters

+ How can you establish a trustworthy presence to them and still set yourself apart from competitors? How will you reflect the overall obstacles users must overcome?
- Theme

+ What will your design say to users and how? Does a formal/informal tone match their expectations? How much text is appropriate?
- Dialogue/Diction

+ How will the overall design pattern appear pleasant and predictable to users, moving them emotionally?
- Melody

+ How will you present everything so the graphics match the setting the users can sense? Would a classic design or stylized, niche layout meet their expectations?
- Décor

+ How can you make your design outstanding so users will remember it?
- Spectacle

+ Is an iterative process in which you seek to understand your users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions which you can prototype and test.
- Design thinking

+ Also known as interactive designers, work to design products that create a positive user experience. Their duties include analyzing consumer requirements and conducting market research to improve a company's product or service. They also work with engineers and product managers to create product prototypes for management review.
- Interaction designers

+ Is a vital part of how we perceive the world around us. Human beings have both short-term and longterm memory capacities, and we can create better designs by understanding how memory works and how we can work with that capacity rather than against it.
- Memory

+ Is a powerful mental process that has many implications on life and how you experience things, from remembering meaningful events to enabling you to execute tasks and achieve goals.
- Human memory

+ Three types of Memories
- Sensory Memory, Short Term Memory, Long Term Memory

+ Are the memories which are stored for tiny time periods and which originate from our sensory organs (such as our eyes or our nose). They are typically retained for less than 500 milliseconds.
- Sensory memories

+ Is often known as iconic memory. Sensory visual memories are the raw information that the brain receives (via the optic nerve) from the eye. 
- Visual sensory memory

+ Is used to process sensory memories which are of interest to us – for whatever reason.
- Short term memory

+ In most instances the memories transferred to our short-term memories are quickly forgotten. This is, probably, a good thing. If we didn’t forget the huge volumes of information that we perceive on a daily basis we could well become overloaded with information and find processing it in a meaningful way soon became impossible.
- Long-Term Memories
