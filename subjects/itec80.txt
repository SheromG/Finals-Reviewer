+ Is traditionally used in HCI to describe the involvement of users and stakeholders in design processes, with pretext of disturbing control to participants to shape their technological future.
- Participation

+ Is the process of learning about ordinary users by observing them in action to understand in detail how they perform their tasks and achieve their intended goals.
- Task Analysis

+ Helps identify the tasks that your website and applications must support and can also help you refine or re-define your site’s navigation or search by determining the appropriate content scope. 
- Task Analysis

+ Is focused on understanding tasks that require decision making, problem solving, memory, attention and judgment.
- Cognitive Task Analysis

+ Is focused on decomposing a high level task subtasks.
- Hierarchical Task Analysis

+ User should not need to close the main application. Continuous access concurrent to main application Windows versus Non windows based systems
- Availability

+ Users who use help system are in difficulty correct error handling and predictable behavior otherwise user will not rely on help for getting assistance.
- Robustness

+ Help matches actual system behaviour Otherwise user is disappointed help covers complete system Otherwise user will be frustrated.
- Accuracy and Completeness

+ Between different parts of the help system and paper documentation In terms of content, terminology and style of presentation.
- Consistency

+ Adaptation of help system according to context allows user to interact in a way appropriate to user experience and task at hand.
- Flexibility

+ Does not prevent the user continuing with normal work.
- Unobtrusiveness

+ Specific tool leads the user through task, step by step, using user’s answers to specific questions
- Wizards task

+ Monitor user behaviour and offer contextual advice can be irritating 
- Assistants

+ Provide information about correct usage when an error occurs.
- Command prompts

+ This process is where ideas are generated. Students can learn empathy here when you teach them new and different ways to find solutions to a problem 
- Ideate

+ This process helps students to see things from different perspectives. It allows them to step outside of what they might think is the obvious solution and instead generate ideas outside of their own realm.
- Ideate

+ Currently used in HCI clearly have their origins in social anthropology.
- Ethnographic approaches

+ Are typically performed with the potential users of a design, as part of an ideation phase or during early concept development.
- User interviews

+ To get insight into users, build empathy and reach them emotionally. Designers create personas to represent target users and add conflict to stories that reflect their user journeys and problems.
- Storytelling

+ What are users trying to achieve/overcome?
- Plot 

+ Who are the users: not just demographically, but what insights do you need to understand what they (and their needs) are truly like?
- Characters

+ How can you establish a trustworthy presence to them and still set yourself apart from competitors? How will you reflect the overall obstacles users must overcome?
- Theme 

+ What will your design say to users and how? Does a formal/informal tone match their expectations? How much text is appropriate?
- Dialogue/Diction

+ How will the overall design pattern appear pleasant and predictable to users, moving them emotionally?
- Melody

+ How will you present everything so the graphics match the setting the users can sense? Would a classic design or stylized, niche layout meet their expectations?
- Decor

+ How can you make your design outstanding so users will remember it?
- Spectacle

+ Is a vital part of how we perceive the world around us. Human beings have both short term and long term memory capacities, and we can create better designs by understanding how memory works and how we can work with that capacity rather than against it.
- Memory

+ Is a powerful mental process that has many implications on life and how you experience things, from remembering meaningful events to enabling you to execute tasks and achieve goals.
- Human memory

+ Are the memories which are stored for tiny time periods and which originate from our sensory organs (such as our eyes or our nose).
- Sensory memories

+ Are descriptions of individual people who represent groups of users that would interact with your system. You use them to guide your design.
- Personas

+ Understand the requirements and explain them in a clear way.
- Requirements

+ Think through what this persona needs.
- Design

+ Identify needs that are or are not being met.
- Evaluation

+ Target the user needs that have already been identified and designed for
- Marketing

+ is a visual or physical representation of the various individuals and groups involved with a particular challenge or system—the stakeholders of your design process in other words.
- Stakeholder map

+ Are people, groups or individuals who have the power either to affect or be affected by the design project you're involved in.
- Stakeholders

+ The ease with which new users can begin effective interaction and achieve maximal performance.
- Learnability

+ The multiplicity of ways in which the user and system exchange information.
- Flexibility

+ The level of support provided to the user in determining successful achievement and assessment of goals.
- Robustness

+ Are abstract design rules, with high generality and low authority.
- Principles 

+ Are specific design rules, high in authority and limited in application.
- Standards

+ Tend to be lower in authority and more general in application.
- Guidelines

+ Is a collection of large amounts of data that is organized into groups or themes based on their relationships.
- Affinity diagram

+ Process is great when you want to make sense of insights gathered during research, as well as when you want to organize ideas generated during ideation sessions.
- Affinity Diagram

+ Focuses on long term studies spanning weeks, months, or even years. Information may be collected through participant observation, interviews, audio or video recording, observer logs, artifact collection, diaries and photographs.
- Traditional ethnography

+ Are typically performed with the potential users of a design, as part of an ideation phase or during early concept development.
- User interviews

+ User help on particular command
- Command assistance
