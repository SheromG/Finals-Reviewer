- Law 1 (human safety): a robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, unless this would violate a higher order law
- Law 2 (robots are slaves): a robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with a higher order law.
- Law 3 (robot survival): a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with a higher order law

+ Robot's Six (6) Main Parts
- Manipulator
- Controller
- Actuators
- End Effector
- Sensors
- Drive

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong> also known as the “Robot Arm”, is a part of the robot that provides motion similar to that of a human arm.
- Manipulator

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong>  is a computer connected to a robot that functions as its “brain”.
- Controller

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong>  is the "engine" that drives the links (the sections between the joints) into their desired position. Without a drive, a robot would just sit there, which is not helpful.
- Drive

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong>  are considered as the “muscles” of the robot. These are combinations of different electro-mechanical devices
- Actuators

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong>  is the tool and device attached to a robot which enables it to accomplish some desired physical function.
- End Effector

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong>  is the perceptual interface between robots and their surroundings. It provides robot controller an information about its configuration
