+ Three laws of robotics by Asimov 
- Law zero: a robot may not injure humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.
- Law 1 (human safety): a robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, unless this would violate a higher order law
- Law 2 (robots are slaves): a robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with a higher order law.
- Law 3 (robot survival): a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with a higher order law

+ Robot's Six (6) Main Parts
- Manipulator
- Controller
- Actuators
- End Effector
- Sensors
- Drive

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong> also known as the “Robot Arm”, is a part of the robot that provides motion similar to that of a human arm.
- Manipulator

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong>  is a computer connected to a robot that functions as its “brain”.
- Controller

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong>  is the "engine" that drives the links (the sections between the joints) into their desired position. Without a drive, a robot would just sit there, which is not helpful.
- Drive

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong>  are considered as the “muscles” of the robot. These are combinations of different electro-mechanical devices
- Actuators

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong>  is the tool and device attached to a robot which enables it to accomplish some desired physical function.
- End Effector

+ <strong>Part of a robot: </strong>  is the perceptual interface between robots and their surroundings. It provides robot controller an information about its configuration
- Sensor

+ Accepts energy already in the environment. These include thermometers, cameras, and 
- Passive Sensor

+ Emits some form of energy and then measures the reflected signals as a way of

+ A circuit project is created and opened. A circuit project includes a variety of electronic components. Electronic components include leds, buttons, resistors, and a power 
- TinkerCAD Circuit

+ Is the process of using information technology (it) in the design and drafting applications. It enhances the ability of the designers and drafters in designing building structures, civil projects and mechanical and manufacturing processes by providing many new tools.Much accuracy and faster generating of output
- Computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) 

+ The core of a cadd system is the
