- Database Design

+ (3) Database Development Life Cycle
- Requirement analysis
- Database Designing
- Implementation

+ Are inputs and outputs that require minimal human intervention.
- System interfaces

+ Are inputs and outputs that more directly involve a system user.
- User interfaces

+ The First principle of user-centered design
- Focus early on the users and their work.

+ The second principle of user-centered design
- Evaluate designs

+ The third principle of user-centered design
- Iterative development 

+ The Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design
- Strive for consistency
- Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
- Offer informative feedback
- Design dialogue to yield closure
- Offer simple error handling
- Permit easy reversal of actions
- Support internal locus of control
- Reduce short-term memory load

+ THE TRANSITION FROM ANALYSIS TO USER INTERFACE DESIGN
- User-Interface Design
- Identifying System Interfaces
- Designing System Inputs
- Designing System Outputs
- Designing Reports, Statements, and TurnaroundDocuments

+ Report Types
- Detailed Reports
- Summary Reports
- Exception Reports
- Executive Reports

+ These contain specific information on business transactions
- Detailed Reports

+ These are often used to recap periodic activity. 
- Summary Reports

+ These provide details or summary information about transactions or operating results that fall outside of a predefined normal range of values.
- Exception Reports

+ Are produced for use within the organization.
- Internal outputs

+ Include statements, notices, and other documents that are produced for people outside the organization.
- External outputs

+ Is an integrated collection of stored data that is centrally managed and controlled
- Database

+ Is a system software component that is generally purchased and installed separately from other system software component
- Database management system

+ Is a DBMS that organizes stored data into structures called tables or relations. 
- Relational database management system 

+ Are mechanisms and procedures that are built into a system to safeguard the system and the information within it.
- Controls

+ It ensures correct system function by rejecting invalid data inputs, preventing unauthorized data outputs, and protecting data and programs against accidental or malicious tampering.
- Integrity Control

+ It tends to be less application specific. The distinction between the two isn’t precise because there is some overlap and because designers typically use both types.
- Security controls

+ These check numeric data inputs to ensure that the amount entered is reasonable. 
- Value limit controls

+ These ensure that all required data values describing an object or transaction are present.
- Completeness controls

+ These ensure that numeric fields containing codes or identifiers are correct.
- Data validation controls

+ These review various combinations of data inputs to ensure that the correct data are entered.
- Field combination controls

+ Commonly used input control types include:
- Value limit controls
- Completeness controls
- Data validation controls
- Field combination controls

+ Is a technique by which any update to the database is logged with such audit information as user ID, date, time, input data, and type of update.
- Transaction logging

+ Common types of output controls include:
- Physical access controls to printers
- Discarded output control
- Access controls to programs that display or print
- Formatting and labeling of printed outputs
- Labeling of electronic outputs

+ Fraud triangle
- Opportunity
- Motivation
- Rationalization

+ The process of identifying users who request access to sensitive resources.
- Authentication 

+ A list attached or linked to a specific resource that describes users or user groups and the nature of permitted access 
- Access control list 

+ The process of allowing or restricting a specific authenticated user’s access to a specific resource based on an access control list.
- Authorization 

+ People who aren’t allowed access to any part or functions of the system.
- Unauthorized users

+ Those who are authorized to access the system. 
- Registered users —

+ People who have access to the source code, executable program, and database structure of the system, including system programmers, application programmers, operators, and system administrators
- Privileged users

+ Is the process of altering data so unauthorized users can’t view them.

- Encryption algorithm 

+ Is a binary input to the encryption algorithm—typically a long string of bits.
- Encryption key

+ Is a protocol for a secure channel to send messages over the Internet.

- Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTPS or HTTP-S) 

+ Different Types of Testing:
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- Usability Testing
- System, Performance and Stress Testing
- User Acceptance Testing

+ Is an integration test of the behavior of an entire system or independent subsystem.
- System test

+ It determines whether a system or subsystem can meet such time based performance criteria as response time or throughput.
- Stress test

+ Descriptions of system requirements, architecture, and construction details
- System documentation

+ Descriptions of how to interact with and use the system
- User documentation

+ The new system is installed and quickly made operational, and any overlapping systems are then turned off
- Direct deployment or Immediate cutover

+ The system is deployed in a series of steps or phases. Each phase adds components or functions to the operational system. 
- Phased deployment

+ One of the most basic decisions to be made about developing a system is the order in which software components will be built or acquired, tested, and deployed.
- Development Order
