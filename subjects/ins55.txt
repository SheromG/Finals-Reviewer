+ Is a deployment where the old and new systems are operated for an extended period of time.
- Parallel Deployment

+ A software project where it pertains a process of controlling and tracing changes in the software
- Software Configuration Management

+ This database is a collection of multiple interconnected database which are spread across various locations
- Distributed Database

+ It is type of report that is being used by high-level managers to assess overall organizational health and performance.
- Executive Reports

+ A control that limits the ability of specific users to access such specific resources as servers, files, Web pages, application programs, and database tables.
- Access Controls

+ Provide the 3 categories of system users
- 1)	Unauthorized / Unregistered Users
- 2)	Registered Users
- 3)	Privileged User

+ Three tiers of discipline tasks/Methods
- 1)	High (Architectural)
- 2)	Low (Detail Design)
- 3)	Physical Design

+ Is the process of defining elements of a system like modules, architecture, components and their interfaces and data for a system based on the specified requirements.
- Systems design

+ Is a proper way of planning and leading software projects.
- Project Management

+ UP disciplines
- Business Modeling
- Requirements
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing 
- Deployment

+ Other UP disciplines
- Configuration nad Change management
- Project management
- Environment

+ Software Project Management consists of several different type of managements:
- Conflict
- Risk
- Requirement
- Change
- Software Configuration
- Release

+ A process to restrict the negative features of conflict while increasing the positive features of conflict.
- Conflict Management

+ An analysis and identification of risks that is followed by synchronized and economical implementation of resources to minimize, operate and control the possibility or effect of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities
- Risk Management

+ A process of analyzing, prioritizing, tracing and documenting on requirements and then supervising change and communicating to pertinent stakeholders.
- Requirement Management

+ A systematic approach for dealing with the transition or transformation of an organization’s goals, processes or technologies. 
- Change Management

+ Involves the task of planning, controlling and scheduling the build in deploying releases.
- Release Management

+ Aspects of Software Project Management
- Planning
- Execution
- Monitoring
- Control

+ System operational environment
- Hardware
- System software
- Networking environment

+ Global collection of networks
- Internet 

+ Private network accessible to internal users
- Intranet

+ Intranet extended to include some external users 
- Extranet

+ Is an iterative process, encompassing topological design, network-synthesis, and network-realization, and is aimed at ensuring that a new telecommunications network or service meets the needs of the subscriber and operator.
- Network planning and design 

+ Is any collection of data whether you are writing it on the paper or storing it in the digital format.
- Database

+ Types of Database 
- Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)
- Online Analysis Processing (OLAP)

+ Is a kind of software that helps you to retrieve,edit and store structured data in the database.
- Database Management System (DBMS)

+ To retrieve this data from the database and process it, you need a data processing unit.
- Query Processing Software

+ Is a collection of objectoriented programming and relational database.
- Object Oriented Database (OODB)

+ Is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. 
- Relational Database

+ is a database management system (DBMS) similar to a relational database, but with an object-oriented database model:
- object–relational database

+ is a collection of processes that facilitate the designing, development, implementation and maintenance of enterprise data management systems. 
- Database Design

+ Database Development Life Cycle
- Requirement analysis
- Database Designing
- Implementation

+ Are inputs and outputs that require minimal human intervention.
- System interfaces

+ Are inputs and outputs that more directly involve a system user.
- User interfaces

+ The First principle of user-centered design
- Focus early on the users and their work.

+ The second principle of user-centered design
- Evaluate designs

+ The third principle of user-centered design
- Iterative development 

+ The Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design
- Strive for consistency
- Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
- Offer informative feedback
- Design dialogue to yield closure
- Offer simple error handling
- Permit easy reversal of actions
- Support internal locus of control
- Reduce short-term memory load

+ THE TRANSITION FROM ANALYSIS TO USER INTERFACE DESIGN
- User-Interface Design
- Identifying System Interfaces
- Designing System Inputs
- Designing System Outputs
- Designing Reports, Statements, and TurnaroundDocuments
